1.  Remeber you have replaced all references to master/work
    all references to master became "primary", and all refernces to worker became "secondary"
    <!-- The worker change, I am not as sure about but will leave there till I get a better descriptor -->

    This has actually made following along the course more intentioned. Having to think through where variables and referneces
    Are actually linked, and how thing flowed into each other. I don't believe it is a HUGE deal, but I do think it counters
    some of the knee jerk reaction of "no politics in IT!"
